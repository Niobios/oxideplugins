**Whitelist** restricts access to your server, only allowing players who have the 'whitelist.allowed' permission from Oxide.

**Permissions**

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **grant user <username|steamid> <permission>**. To remove a permission, use **revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>**.

**whitelist.allowed** (allows player to connect to the server)
**Ex.** grant user Wulf whitelist.allowed
**Ex.** revoke user Wulf whitelist.allowed

**Localization**

The default messages are in the Whitelist.en.json under the oxide/lang directory, or create a language file for another language using the 'en' file as a default.
